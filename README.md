# DEPLOY04_FLASK_APP

<h1 align=center>EKS deployment of my </h1>

Welcome to this deployment of my chef application, It was previously a monolith and my goal is to seperate the app into microservices and use EKS to manage those microservices.

- This is an ongoing project from which I hope to understand and help other understand the microservice architecture as well as K8s.
